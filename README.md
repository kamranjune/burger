I was able to get the db, orm, model/burger.js, and controllers/burger_controller.js to make sense 
for the selectall and the insertOne logic and routing.

but because I was not able to figure out the handlebars view for moving the burger from
left to right, i was not able to get the update functionality either.

I need a better understanding of how handlebars outputs html views and css too.
especially with partials
